### Class 13: Logistic Regression

**Logistic Regression Resources:**
* To go deeper into logistic regression, read the first three sections of Chapter 4 of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), or watch the [first three videos](http://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/) (30 minutes) from that chapter.
* For a more mathematical explanation of logistic regression, watch the first seven videos (71 minutes) from week 3 of Andrew Ng's [machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info), or read the [related lecture notes](http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/06_Logistic_Regression.html) compiled by a student.
* For more on interpreting logistic regression coefficients, read this excellent [guide](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/faq/general/odds_ratio.htm) by UCLA's IDRE and these [lecture notes](http://www.unm.edu/~schrader/biostat/bio2/Spr06/lec11.pdf) from the University of New Mexico.
* The scikit-learn documentation has a nice [explanation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html) of what it means for a predicted probability to be calibrated.
* [Supervised learning superstitions cheat sheet](http://ryancompton.net/assets/ml_cheat_sheet/supervised_learning.html) is a very nice comparison of four classifiers we cover in the course (logistic regression, decision trees, KNN, Naive Bayes) and one classifier we do not cover (Support Vector Machines).
* What is the [C hyperparameter for Logistic Regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_logistic_l1_l2_sparsity.html)
* What is the [difference between the sigmoid and softmax function](http://dataaspirant.com/2017/03/07/difference-between-softmax-function-and-sigmoid-function/)
* How does [multinomial logistic regression works](http://dataaspirant.com/2017/03/14/multinomial-logistic-regression-model-works-machine-learning/)
