Intro to Data Science,10,10,10,I liked the end with actually going through python syntax,Seemed like it went a little quicker than Alex expected but he adjusted and we went into the next lesson.,,No
Intro to Data Science,10,9,10,Adam is great.,I liked it.,NO,No
Intro to Data Science,9,7,10,Loved your overview of real examples to apply various parts of the data science workflow and real world examples,Felt like you forgot a few things you had to come back to later. Not a big deal but it left some context hanging,Felt like today was straight forward. Was nice to try spyder and need to focus again on python syntax so will be getting back up to speed.,No
Intro to Data Science,8,8,8,Good combination of overview and specifics!,Making sure everyone has done all the pre-work.,Nope,No

Intro to Data Science,5,6,6,Interactive,more prepared,,No
Intro to Data Science,9,10,10,"Clustering example--good interactive lesson and gave us a practical example of how data can be skewed, inappropriate for the questions at hand, etc","I feel very comfortable with basic Python syntax, so that part was less useful to me",,No
Intro to Data Science,7,8,8,Overview about DS,"When we start coding practice on Spyder, frame the section for us and tell us what the objective is. Were we just getting familiar with Spyder's interface? Were we supposed to learn common coding errors? etc.",no,No
Intro to Data Science,9,9,9,I liked overview of being a data scientists and the 6 star skillset,"Everything was good, but clarifying the exercise when we split into groups could be an improvement. For example, I was a bit confused the difference between ""1. Question"" and ""2. Evaluation.""",,No
Intro to Data Science,8,8,9,Good review,Please show the difference between python 2.7 and the version you are using,,No

"Git, GitHub, and Command Line",8,9,9,Hands on,more practice,,No
"Git, GitHub, and Command Line",9,9,8,I liked the diagrams explaining where we were pulling and pushing code to.,I think a more detailed explanation of the add/commit process (with actual files to see the differences in real time) would have been more helpful,,No
"Git, GitHub, and Command Line",10,10,10,Fast paced but efficient,Not much,Nope,No
"Git, GitHub, and Command Line",10,10,10,Great structure to go through all the applicable command line/ =git syntax,"Little bit fast-paced, but seemingly necessary",,No
"Git, GitHub, and Command Line",9,8,6,I liked learning git.,The pace was sometimes a little confusing - we'd go really slow and then we'd go really quickly through the exercises (without time to go back through them multiple times). I just took a look at the homework and I don't know that we went through enough exactly how to tackle these questions (i.e. this command will answer this question).,,No
"Git, GitHub, and Command Line",10,10,10,I thought I would be crashed because I didn't do the prep work. But the step-by-step tutorial was actually very useful. I was panicking a little bit in the beginning due to the different MacOS system. But Adam's help was on time and super useful.,Make sure all Mac users' know where to set up the terminal and install git.,n/a,Yes
"Git, GitHub, and Command Line",8,8,10,Intro of new technology (Github),A step-by-step walk-through sheet of the github versioning process,No,No
"Git, GitHub, and Command Line",10,10,10,More confidence. Great comparisons to outside examples. Good pace,"Don't tell people things are confusing - it sets the message in their heads. Theres a protocol/process, there are dangers - but this doesn't need to be confusing",No - great job!,No
"Git, GitHub, and Command Line",7,7,7,Lot of content,A little bit confusing about git,,No
"Git, GitHub, and Command Line",8,8,8,Understanding how Git and GitHub interact,It was great,Nope great job,Yes
"Git, GitHub, and Command Line",8,9,8,diagrams to help visualize the concepts,a little more exercises together as a class,The class topic was Git. The field doesn't allow you to fill in and the one drop down option doesn't make sense.,No
Pandas,9,9,9,Good to review Pandas!,NA,Nope,No
Pandas,8,8,8,I liked the focus on coding for most of the class,There were some issues with outdated code (that Spyder wouldnt accept) that caused speedbumps.,,No
Pandas,10,8,8,the Pandas syntax,the first narrative part in the beginning,,No
Pandas,10,10,10,I feel like I have a good grasp of pandas in python,"Adam did a great job but I feel like the level of understanding in the class varies so widely (and skews toward experienced) that unless you've taught this specific class 20x, it's hard to adjust to make it faster/slower paced to meet everyone's needs",,No
Pandas,6,7,9,Good presence in the room and overall good flow,Didn't like your switch of notation . to [ ] notation which varied from the exercises. I get it's a personal preference but it adds unnecessary complexity to the class.,,No
Pandas,10,8,9,The pandas portion of the lesson was laid out very well,"More time on python, less time on SMART powerpoints",N/A,No
Pandas,7,6,7,Good to get into the data and use Pandas,More time for exercises,Nope,No
Pandas + Visualization,9,9,9,Response to follow-on questions,N/A,No,No
Pandas + Visualization,6,8,7,Spyder file is well organized,Timing,"There's a LOT of material to cover in 3.5 hours, going to need a lot of practice.",No
Pandas + Visualization,6,6,5,challenged,lower paste plz,,Yes
Pandas + Visualization,8,7,6,Good references on where to pull extra information to better understand functions,Continue to walk through what you're doing. The explanations help as do group readouts. Both would be more engaging,,No
Pandas + Visualization,10,6,10,I liked learning about visualizations and more about using pandas (I wish there was more of an explanation about pandas vs. python and how pandas acts as a library of functions),"Adam's lesson did not feel very organized. There were only 4 or so 5-minute exercises which didn't leave time for 1:1 questions - with only 1 instructor, most people don't want to interrupt as the lesson is going.",I feel prepared to practice by myself.,No
Pandas + Visualization,10,10,10,Very well-structured for the major topics,Covered a lot and did not thoroughly get through the material,,No
Pandas + Visualization,7,9,7,"I liked the focus on the different options for each function/attribute, so that we can modify them to our needs.","This class moved a lot faster for me than the previous classes, so it was harder for me to keep up 100% of the time.",,No
Pandas + Visualization,8,8,8,Good pandas experience,Covered a lot so perhaps not as much time to really think things through,Nope,No
Intro to Machine Learning,10,10,10,Alex is good,More notes,"I think it is good for us to struggle, but also good for you to go over the material",No
Intro to Machine Learning,10,10,8,"Good flow, format and application. Liked how you broke it into learn then discuss/work exercises to reinforce.",In addition to the homework - can you point out which areas in your reference area would be beneficial to review or read before class. I am doing ok with in class exercises but I'd like to find some problems or other places I can get some extra practical experience,The next two weeks are leading up to my company's Global Conference which I'm playing a large role in. Any class supplement material I could practice on my own so I'm not getting lost would be great,No
Intro to Machine Learning,9,9,9,I liked the end-of-class exercises.,It was a bit unclear when we used graphs to talk about problem identification and research feasibility. I got a bit lost of why we did that.,n/a,No
6. Web Scraping & APIs,10,10,10,More hands on activities.,Better but concise intros. May be nice to get a survey before class where we can prioritize the areas we'd like to explore as a class.,Really like the way you teach,No
6. Web Scraping & APIs,8,10,5,"Getting to know the relationship among web scraping, web animation, and API",I would prefer having some pre-class reading material in order to understand this material better.,,No
6. Web Scraping & APIs,10,10,10,Pace,N/A,No,No
6. Web Scraping & APIs,10,10,10,Really liked this call - very hands-on and the material covered seems useful from a day-to-day data science standpoint,N/A,,No
6. Web Scraping & APIs,7,8,8,APIs,More focus on APIs as opposed to scraping,Very helpful. Selenium didn't work though,No
6. Web Scraping & APIs,10,10,10,LOVED how interactive this lesson was! I thought Alex did a GREAT job of narrating what was happening and the scenarios in which you'd use each command.,We went a little quickly toward the end so the narration was lost a tiny bit (with the API section which I was really looking forward to learning). But really overall - this was my kind of class. Loved it.,,No
7. K-Nearest Neighbors,6,6,6,Overview of approaches to models,Tied it to a point - it took a long time before you were able to connect it with the class topic.,Lots of people were saying the homework isn't aligning to class resources.,No
7. K-Nearest Neighbors,10,10,10,Learned everything really well.,Not much,,Yes
7. K-Nearest Neighbors,9,10,6,detailed,nothing,,Yes
7. K-Nearest Neighbors,8,8,8,I liked how we switched back and forth between what we were coding and why we were doing it in a bigger sense--easier to understand than having the first part of the class be big concepts and then code for the second half,NA,,Yes
7. K-Nearest Neighbors,10,10,8,KNN's advantages and disadvantages,n/a,,Yes
8. Evaluating Model Fit 1,10,10,10,"Liked to quick back and forth between setting up the idea, running into a practical, and reinforcing",Good to go boss,I like seeing the pre-reads. Hoping that leads to us being able to interact more with questions for next class,No
8. Evaluating Model Fit 1,10,10,10,-,"I felt like I just pressing ctrl+enter to run the code. I wish we did more code along (like with the web scraping!) - so our starter code books are blank and we have to fill in along with Alex, as he narrates what we're doing and why",,No
8. Evaluating Model Fit 1,8,8,8,bias,cross validation,,No
8. Evaluating Model Fit 1,6,8,6,The diagrams drawn on the wall with the explanations.,"The notebooks. I got stressed out whenever there is an error message coming up. This would cost me time to look and fix the errors. By the time I went back to Alex, the course had already jumped a lot.",n/a,No
8. Evaluating Model Fit 1,10,10,10,Theory explainations,N/a,,No
9. Evaluating Model Fit 2,10,10,10,Explanation,It was fine,,No

9. Evaluating Model Fit 2,8,9,7,Challenging concepts presented in a clear fashion,"Very complicated statistical/validation topics today - would be good to spend more time on each of these individual models, perhaps splitting the class into 2. Although they were presented clearly, lots of questions seem to remain unanswered",,No
9. Evaluating Model Fit 2,10,10,10,Model eval,N/A,,Yes
10. Natural Language Processing 1,10,10,10,"Great pace, walk through and additional explanations",Nothing - best class so far,,No
10. Natural Language Processing 1,7,9,7,Robust content,too much for one class,,No
10. Natural Language Processing 1,9,9,7,Interesting overview of NLP,Nothing,Just need to review.,No
10. Natural Language Processing 1,5,9,4,Adding NLP to my peripheral knowledge,Could be split up into separate lessons? Not sure,I'm still a bit fuzzy on basic modeling. I think there could be an optional homework on KNN or something for practice on basic modeling principles,No
