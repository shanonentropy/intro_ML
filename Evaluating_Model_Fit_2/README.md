### Class 9: Evaluating Model Fit 2


**Confusion Matrix Resources:**
* [simple guide to confusion matrix terminology](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/) may be useful to you as a reference.
* This notebook (from another DAT course) explains [how to calculate "expected value"](https://github.com/podopie/DAT18NYC/blob/master/classes/13-expected_value_cost_benefit_analysis.ipynb) from a confusion matrix by treating it as a cost-benefit matrix.
* Watch Rahul Patwari's videos on [Intuitive sensitivity and specificity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4_3fditnWg) (9 minutes) and [The tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtYDyGGeQyo) (13 minutes).

**Classification Metrics:**
* The Basics of [Classifier Evaluation, Part 1](https://www.svds.com/the-basics-of-classifier-evaluation-part-1/)
* The Basics of [Classifier Evaluation, Part 2](https://svds.com/classifiers2/)
* Making sense of [logarithmic loss](http://www.exegetic.biz/blog/2015/12/making-sense-logarithmic-loss/)
* This blog post about [Amazon Machine Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-machine-learning-make-data-driven-decisions-at-scale/) contains a neat [graphic](https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2015/ml_adjust_model_1.png) showing how classification threshold affects different evaluation metrics.

**ROC Resources:**
* Rahul Patwari has a great video on [ROC Curves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Igj5Pr6u4) (12 minutes).
* [An introduction to ROC analysis](http://people.inf.elte.hu/kiss/13dwhdm/roc.pdf) is a very readable paper on the topic.
* ROC curves can be used across a wide variety of applications, such as [comparing different feature sets](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/205472/aisec10-leontjeva.pdf) for detecting fraudulent Skype users, and [comparing different classifiers](http://www.cse.ust.hk/nevinZhangGroup/readings/yi/Bradley_PR97.pdf) on a number of popular datasets.
* Classifier [decision-functions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning/lecture/0YPe1/classifier-decision-functions)

**Distance Metrics:**
* The [five most popular similarity measure](https://dataaspirant.com/2015/04/11/five-most-popular-similarity-measures-implementation-in-python/)
