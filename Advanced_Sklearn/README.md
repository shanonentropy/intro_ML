### Class 19: Advanced scikit-learn 

**scikit-learn Resources:**
* This is a longer example of [feature scaling](https://github.com/rasbt/pattern_classification/blob/master/preprocessing/about_standardization_normalization.ipynb) in scikit-learn, with additional discussion of the types of scaling you can use.
* [Practical Data Science in Python](http://radimrehurek.com/data_science_python/) is a long and well-written notebook that uses a few advanced scikit-learn features: pipelining, plotting a learning curve, and pickling a model.
* Sebastian Raschka has a number of excellent resources for scikit-learn users, including a repository of [tutorials and examples](https://github.com/rasbt/pattern_classification), a library of machine learning [tools and extensions](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/), a new [book](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book), and a semi-active [blog](http://sebastianraschka.com/blog/).
* scikit-learn has an incredibly active [mailing list](https://www.mail-archive.com/scikit-learn-general@lists.sourceforge.net/index.html) that is often much more useful than Stack Overflow for researching functions and asking questions.
* If you forget how to use a particular scikit-learn function that we have used in class, don't forget that this repository is fully searchable!

**Pipelines**
* Helper functions: [Pipeline](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html), [GridSearchCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html)
* To learn how to use [GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html) for parameter tuning, watch [How to find the best model parameters in scikit-learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gol_qOgRqfA) (28 minutes) or read the [associated notebook](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/08_grid_search.ipynb).
* Pipeline and FeatureUnion: [combining estimators](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html#pipeline)
* Feature Union with [Heterogeneous Data Sourse](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/hetero_feature_union.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-hetero-feature-union-py)

### Class 20: Final Projects

## Additional Resources

**Tidy Data**
* [Good Data Management Practices for Data Analysis](https://www.prometheusresearch.com/good-data-management-practices-for-data-analysis-tidy-data-part-2/) briefly summarizes the principles of "tidy data".
* [Hadley Wickham's paper](http://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) explains tidy data in detail and includes lots of good examples.
* Example of a tidy dataset: [Bob Ross](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/bob-ross/elements-by-episode.csv)
* Examples of untidy datasets: [NFL ticket prices](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/nfl-ticket-prices/2014-average-ticket-price.csv), [airline safety](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/airline-safety/airline-safety.csv), [Jets ticket prices](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/nfl-ticket-prices/jets-buyer.csv), [Chipotle orders](https://github.com/TheUpshot/chipotle/blob/master/orders.tsv)
* If your co-workers tend to create spreadsheets that are [unreadable by computers](https://bosker.wordpress.com/2014/12/05/the-government-statistical-services-terrible-spreadsheet-advice/), they may benefit from reading these [tips for releasing data in spreadsheets](http://www.clean-sheet.org/). (There are some additional suggestions in this [answer](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/83614/best-practices-for-creating-tidy-data/83711#83711) from Cross Validated.)

**Regular Expressions Resources:**
* Google's Python Class includes an excellent [introductory lesson](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions) on regular expressions (which also has an associated [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWyoYtvJpe4&index=4&list=PL5-da3qGB5IA5NwDxcEJ5dvt8F9OQP7q5)).
* Python for Informatics has a nice [chapter](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/book012.html) on regular expressions. (If you want to run the examples, you'll need to download [mbox.txt](http://www.py4inf.com/code/mbox.txt) and [mbox-short.txt](http://www.py4inf.com/code/mbox-short.txt).)
* [Breaking the Ice with Regular Expressions](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/breaking-the-ice-with-regular-expressions/) is an interactive Code School course, though only the first "level" is free.
* If you want to go really deep with regular expressions, [RexEgg](http://www.rexegg.com/) includes endless articles and tutorials.
* [5 Tools You Didn't Know That Use Regular Expressions](http://blog.codeschool.io/2015/07/30/5-tools-you-didnt-know-that-use-regular-expressions/) demonstrates how regular expressions can be used with Excel, Word, Google Spreadsheets, Google Forms, text editors, and other tools.
* [Exploring Expressions of Emotions in GitHub Commit Messages](http://geeksta.net/geeklog/exploring-expressions-emotions-github-commit-messages/) is a fun example of how regular expressions can be used for data analysis, and [Emojineering](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/118304328152/emojineering-part-2-implementing-hashtag-emoji) explains how Instagram uses regular expressions to detect emoji in hashtags.

**Feature Selection**
* [Feature Selection](http://blog.datadive.net/selecting-good-features-part-i-univariate-selection/)

**Dimensionality Reduction Resources:**
* A more thorough and friendly introduction to [PCA](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_pca_in_3_steps.html)
* Chapters 6 and 10 in [ISLR](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) cover feature selection and dimensionality reduction in an accessible manner.
* A slightly more in-depth discussion of the [kernel trick](http://www.eric-kim.net/eric-kim-net/posts/1/kernel_trick.html).
* [introduction-to-principal-component-analysis](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/introduction-to-principal-component-analysis)
